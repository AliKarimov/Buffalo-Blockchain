## Introduction
What is Buffalo Blockchain?
Buffalo Blockchain is an avant-garde, decentralized platform that fuses the world of blockchain technology with lottery gaming and financial investment opportunities. Fortuna aims to redefine the conventional gaming industry by establishing an ecosystem where transparency, fairness, and unlimited liquidity are not just buzzwords but a reality for every user.

By breaking down barriers and eliminating middlemen, we enable everyone to participate in a fair and financially rewarding ecosystem.

**Vision**
Buffalo envisions a world where blockchain technology transcends the limitations of traditional systems. Our platform aims to empower users to be more than just participants. By investing in Fortuna, you become a stakeholder in an ever-growing ecosystem that offers not just gaming opportunities but also a plethora of financial instruments for investment and wealth generation.
By emphasizing community governance, Fortuna places the future of the platform in the hands of those who matter most—the users. As we grow, we seek to add more features and products that align with our community's needs and aspirations, making Buffalo a truly user-centric platform.

In the long run, Fortuna aims to be more than just a gaming platform; it will be a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem that meets various financial needs, aligning perfectly with advancements in blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

Card Structure: Each card contains 18 unique digits, arranged in three rows. Each row contains 6 digits.
Sample Card



 
Note: One of the digits in each card will be colored red (bonus)


4. Game Mechanics
•	Game Start: Once the players have selected their cards, the game commences.
•	Random Numbers: Numbers are randomly drawn from the 90 barrels. As the numbers are drawn, players mark off the corresponding numbers on their cards.
•	Winning Criteria: The first player to mark off one complete row of numbers on their card wins the game.
4.1 Game Attributes
•	Tickets (Cards): Tickets are numbered from 1 to 90 (inclusive).
•	Number of Cards: There are a total of 450 cards, divided into groups: 001-090; 101-190; 201-290; 301-390; 401-490.
•	Number Barrels: The game includes 90 barrels, each numbered from 1 to 90.
•	4.2 Game Conditions
•	Player Selection: Each player selects a card (ticket).
•	Ticket Structure: Each ticket contains 18 unique digits distributed across three rows, with 6 digits in each row. One of the digits is highlighted in red and is considered a bonus.

•	4.3 Game Process
•	Game Start: The game commences after players have acquired their tickets.
•	Number Drawing: During the game, random numbers are drawn (randomized). These numbers are used to mark corresponding digits on players' tickets.
•	Winning Condition: The first player to complete one of the vertical lines on their ticket is declared the winner of the round.

5. Bonus Mechanisms
•	Bonus 1: The first drawn number determines the bonus card(s). For example, if the first drawn number is 17, then card numbers 17, 117, 217, 317, and 417 become bonus cards for that game.
•	Bonus 2: The red (bonus) number. If a player marks off a complete row and the last number marked is the red number, they win the standard prize pool plus a red-number bonus.
•	Bonus 3: Jackpot conditions. If a player manages to mark off one row with the first six numbers drawn, they win a full Bitcoin or equivalent in Satoshi.

•	Multiple Winners: If more than one card wins, the prize pool is divided equally among the winning cards.

•	Card Limit: A player can purchase up to 10 cards per game.
This innovative approach ensures not only excitement and fairness but also integrates the benefits of blockchain to enhance trust and community participation.
